Improvements:

Removes the unnecessary synchronized block within getInstance, relying on the volatile field for thread safety and visibility.
Uses double-checked locking to improve efficiency in subsequent calls to getInstance after the instance is created. This ensures proper synchronization only when necessary.
Maintains the same functionality for the parse method.
Explanation:

The volatile keyword guarantees visibility and ordering of reads and writes of the instance variable across different threads.
Double-checked locking ensures that the creation of the instance happens only once in a thread-safe manner while avoiding unnecessary synchronization overhead in subsequent calls.
This approach is generally considered more performant and efficient for singleton implementations in modern Java compared to the double synchronized version. Remember to choose the most suitable approach based on your specific performance requirements and coding preferences.
